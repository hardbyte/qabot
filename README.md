# qabot

Query local or remote files with natural language queries powered by
OpenAI's `gpt` and `duckdb` ðŸ¦†.

Can query local and remote files (CSV, parquet)

## Installation

Install with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/):

```
pipx install qabot
```

## Security Risks

This program gives an LLM access to your local and network accessible files and allows it to execute arbitrary SQL queries, see `Security.md` for more information.

## Command Line Usage

```bash
$ EXPORT OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
$ EXPORT QABOT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
$ qabot -w -q "How many Hospitals are there located in Beijing"
Query: How many Hospitals are there located in Beijing
There are 39 hospitals located in Beijing.
Total tokens 1749 approximate cost in USD: 0.05562
```

## Python Usage

```python
from qabot import ask_wikidata, ask_file, ask_database

print(ask_wikidata("How many hospitals are there in New Zealand?"))
print(ask_file("How many men were aboard the titanic?", 'data/titanic.csv'))
print(ask_database("How many product images are there?", 'postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname'))
```

Output:
```text
There are 54 hospitals in New Zealand.
There were 577 male passengers on the Titanic.
There are 6,225 product images.
```


## Features

Works on local CSV and Excel files:

remote CSV files:

```
$ qabot -f https://duckdb.org/data/holdings.csv -q "Tell me how many Apple holdings I currently have"
 ðŸ¦† Creating local DuckDB database...
 ðŸ¦† Loading data...
create view 'holdings' as select * from 'https://duckdb.org/data/holdings.csv';
 ðŸš€ Sending query to LLM
 ðŸ§‘ Tell me how many Apple holdings I currently have


 ðŸ¤– You currently have 32.23 shares of Apple.


This information was obtained by summing up all the Apple ('APPL') shares in the holdings table.

SELECT SUM(shares) as total_shares FROM holdings WHERE ticker = 'APPL'
```

Even on (public) data stored in S3:

You can even load data from disk/URL via the natural language query:

> Load the file 'data/titanic.csv' into a table called 'raw_passengers'. 
> Create a view of the raw passengers table for just the male passengers. What 
> was the average fare for surviving male passengers?

```
~/Dev/qabot> qabot -q "Load the file 'data/titanic.csv' into a table called 'raw_passengers'. Create a view of the raw passengers table for just the male passengers. What was the average fare for surviving male passengers?" -v

 ðŸš€ Question:

average fare for surviving male passengers?
 ðŸ¤– The average fare for surviving male passengers was approximately $40.82.


The average fare for surviving male passengers was calculated by creating a view called `male_passengers` to filter only the male passengers from the `titanic`    
table, and then running a query to calculate the average fare for male passengers who survived. The calculated average fare is approximately $40.82.

CREATE VIEW male_passengers AS SELECT * FROM titanic WHERE Sex = 'male';
SELECT AVG(Fare) as average_fare FROM male_passengers WHERE Survived = 1;

```

## Quickstart

You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key, 
which you can get from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Install the `qabot` command line tool using pip/pipx:


```bash
$ pip install -U qabot
```

Then run the `qabot` command with either local files (`-f my-file.csv`) or `-w` to query wikidata.


## Examples

### Local CSV file/s

```bash
$ qabot -q "how many passengers survived by gender?" -f data/titanic.csv
ðŸ¦† Loading data from files...
Loading data/titanic.csv into table titanic...

Query: how many passengers survived by gender?
Result:
There were 233 female passengers and 109 male passengers who survived.


 ðŸš€ any further questions? [y/n] (y): y

 ðŸš€ Query: what was the largest family who did not survive? 
Query: what was the largest family who did not survive?
Result:
The largest family who did not survive was the Sage family, with 8 members.

 ðŸš€ any further questions? [y/n] (y): n
```


## Query WikiData

Use the `-w` flag to query wikidata. For best results use a `gpt-4` or similar model.
```bash
$ EXPORT QABOT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
$ qabot -w -q "How many Hospitals are there located in Beijing"
```

## Intermediate steps and database queries

Use the `-v` flag to see the intermediate steps and database queries.
Sometimes it takes a long route to get to the answer, but it's interesting to see how it gets there.

```
qabot -f data/titanic.csv -q "how many passengers survived by gender?" -v
```

## Data accessed via http/s3

Use the `-f <url>` flag to load data from a url, e.g. a csv file on s3:

```bash
$ qabot -f s3://covid19-lake/enigma-jhu-timeseries/csv/jhu_csse_covid_19_timeseries_merged.csv -q "how many confirmed cases of covid are there?" -v
ðŸ¦† Loading data from files...
create table jhu_csse_covid_19_timeseries_merged as select * from 's3://covid19-lake/enigma-jhu-timeseries/csv/jhu_csse_covid_19_timeseries_merged.csv';

Result:
264308334 confirmed cases
```



## Ideas

- optionally pass in a context file to pass directly to the LLM
- streaming mode to output results as they come in
- token limits and better reporting of costs
- Supervisor agent - assess whether a query is "safe" to run, could ask for user confirmation to run anything that gets flagged.
- Often we can zero-shot the question and get a single query out - perhaps we try this before the MKL chain
- test each zeroshot agent individually
- Generate and pass back assumptions made to the user
- Add an optional "clarify" tool to the chain that asks the user to clarify the question
- Create a query checker tool that checks if the query looks valid and/or safe
- Inject AWS credentials into duckdb so we can access private resources in S3
